# Note Taker

## Description

This application is a simple note taker that uses an internal server to keep track of written notes. It contains functions to both write and delete notes, as well as viewing already written notes, the latter of which is kept read-only. This application provides a simple yet effective method of keeping track of a list of tasks that can be easily shared to others, thus reducing the need to scroll through chat logs or emails.
