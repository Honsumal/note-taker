# Note Taker

## Description

This application is a simple note taker that uses an internal server to keep track of written notes. It contains functions to both write and delete notes, as well as viewing already written notes, the latter of which is kept read-only. This application provides a simple yet effective method of keeping track of a list of tasks that does not rely on local storage, thus reducing the amount of memory needed.
